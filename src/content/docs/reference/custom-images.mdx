This guide explains how to add and use your own image files for logos and service icons within your KISS configuration.

### Prepare Your Assets Folder
To start, you need a dedicated folder for your images:
  - **Create the Folder**: Inside your defined KISS config folder, create a new subdirectory named `assets`.
  - **Place Your Images**: Put all of your custom image files into this new `assets` folder.

### Supported Image Formats
KISS will only recognize and inject files with the following extensions into the Docker container:
  - `png`
  - `jpg`
  - `jpeg`
  - `gif`
  - `svg`
  - `webp`

### Reference Custom Images in Configuration
Once your images are in the `assets` folder, you can reference them using a relative path starting with `./assets/` followed by the filename.

You can use custom images with the following configuration properties:

|  Property  |  Description                |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| **[customLogo](/kiss/reference/configuration/#customlogo)** | Used in the root configuration object to set the main header logo. |
| **[iconUrl](/kiss/reference/configuration/#iconurl)** | Used within a service object to set the icon for that specific service. |


#### 💡 Example Configuration
Here is how you would use a file named `file.jpg` for both the main logo and a service icon in your config.json:

```json
{
  "title": "My Awesome Homelab",
  "checkHealth": true,
  "customLogo": "./assets/file.jpg",
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "some-service",
      "displayName": "Some local service",
      "internalUrl": "http://local-service:1234",
      "iconUrl": "./assets/file.jpg",
      "overrideCheckHealth": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Apply Changes
After modifying your configuration file and placing your images in the `assets` folder, you must **restart the KISS Docker container** for the changes to take effect. Your custom images will then be injected and displayed on your KISS homepage.
