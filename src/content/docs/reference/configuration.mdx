## Configure the `config.json` file
KISS is configured using a `config.json` file that you provide. Below is a detailed reference of the configuration options available.

### `title` **(required)**
**type**: `string`

The title of your KISS homepage. This will be displayed at the top of the page unless disabled.
This is also used as the page title in the browser tab.

### `checkHealth`
**type**: `boolean`

**default**: `false`

If set to `true`, KISS will check the health of each service by making a request to its URL or internal URL and indicate if the service is reachable.

### `disableLogo`
**type**: `boolean`

**default**: `false`

If set to `true`, the logo will not be displayed on the homepage. This includes both the default logo and any custom logo you may have set.

### `disableTitle`
**type**: `boolean`

**default**: `false`

If set to `true`, the title will not be displayed on the homepage. This can be useful for a cleaner look if you prefer not to show the title.

### `disableFooter`
**type**: `boolean`

**default**: `false`

If set to `true`, the footer section at the bottom of the homepage will be hidden.

### `customLogo`
**type**: `string` (URL or local path)

You can provide a URL or a local path to a custom logo image to be displayed on the homepage. If not set, the default KISS logo will be used.

<Aside type="caution">This has not been fully implemented yet, it will only work if you manually add an image to the nginx html folder and point to it with a local path (e.g. `./local-logo.svg`).</Aside>

### `services` **(required)**
**type**: `array` of [service](#service-object) objects.

An array of service objects that define the services to be displayed on the homepage. Refer to the [service](#service-object) section for details on how to configure each service.

There should be at least one service defined in this array.

---


## Service Object
Each service object in the `services` array can have the following properties:

### `id` **(required)**
**type**: `string`

A unique identifier for the service. This is used internally and should not repeat across services.

### `displayName` **(required)**
**type**: `string`

The name of the service as it will appear on the homepage. This should be a user-friendly name and can include spaces and capitalization.

### `url`
**type**: `string` (URL)

The public URL of the service. This is the link that users will be directed to when they click on the service card.

If health check is enabled for this service and `internalUrl` is not provided, this URL will also be used to check if the service is reachable.

### `internalUrl`
**type**: `string` (URL)

An internal URL for the service, typically used for health checks. This is useful if you want to check a different endpoint than the one users will visit.

If health check is enabled for this service, this URL will be used to check if the service is reachable. If not provided, the `url` will be used instead.

### `iconUrl`
**type**: `string` (URL)

A URL to an icon image representing the service. This icon will be displayed on the service card.

If not provided, no icon will be displayed.

<Aside>You can use any image hosting service or a CDN to host your icons. In the future, these icons will be cached and served locally for better performance and offline availability.</Aside>

### `overrideCheckHealth`
**type**: `boolean`

If defined, this value will override the global `checkHealth` setting for this specific service. This allows you to enable or disable health checks on a per-service basis.
