import {Tabs, TabItem} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

KISS is a fast, minimal, and static launcher for your self-hosted services or favorite websites. Built with Astro and Preact, it's designed to be a somewhat lightweight and good-looking alternative to more complex dashboards.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to deploy KISS is using **Docker Compose**, but you can also use plain Docker if you prefer.

<Tabs syncKey="deployment">
<TabItem label="Docker Compose">

### Run with Docker Compose

Use the following `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/caslus/kiss:latest
    container_name: kiss
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
    # change ./config.json to the path of your config file
    # or create one in the same directory as this docker-compose.yml
      - ./config.json:/app/external/config.json
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Docker Run">

### Run using `docker run`

Use the following command, adjusting the path to your `config.json` file as needed:

```bash
docker run \
  --name kiss \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./config.json:/app/external/config.json \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/caslus/kiss:latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Configuration File
To set up your own `config.json`, you can start with this example:

```json
{
  "title": "My Awesome Homelab",
  "checkHealth": true,
  "customLogo": "./local-logo.svg",
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "plex",
      "displayName": "Plex Media Server",
      "url": "https://plex.example.com",
      "iconUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/icons/plex.svg"
    },
    {
      "id": "some-service",
      "displayName": "Some local service",
      "internalUrl": "http://local-service:1234",
      "overrideCheckHealth": false
    }
  ]
}
```
