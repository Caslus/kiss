description: Instructions for setting up a local development environment for KISS.

To set up a local development environment for KISS, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your machine.

After cloning the KISS repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Run development server:**
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
    *(Requires a local `config.json` file for the dev server. You can copy the example from the root directory and rename it to `config.json`.)*

You can now access the KISS application using the dev server at `http://localhost:4321`. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the application in your browser.
