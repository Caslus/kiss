**KISS** is a fast, minimal, and static launcher for your self-hosted services or favorite websites. Built with **Astro** and **Preact**, it's designed to be a somewhat lightweight and good-looking alternative to more complex dashboards.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Insane Performance:** Static frontend built with Astro, loads pretty quick if you were to ask me. 😉
* **Simple Configuration:** Uses a single `config.json` file. Change the JSON, restart the container, done.
* **Type Safe:** Configuration is validated at runtime. If something is wrong, the page gives you clear feedback.
* **Docker-Native:** Ships ready for deployment via Docker, handling config injection seamlessly.
